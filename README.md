## `sectors` Knowledge Base

`sectors-kb` contains a collection of recipes and tutorials to help you get started with the Sectors API. For the most part, you'd need an account with Sectors to make the most out of the API examples in the cookbook.

### Recipe
All recipes are written in markdown format and are [stored in the `recipe` directory](/recipe/).
Each recipe is a standalone document that contains a brief introduction, a list of prerequisites, a step-by-step guide to follow, and some additional notes or tips that the author finds useful.

The recipes are designed to be easy to follow and can be used as a reference guide when working with the Sectors API.

### Glossary
We build Sectors to be a comprehensive source of Indonesia-first financial data and financial information. It offers a web interface and an API platform to interact and engage with the data. We also want Sectors to be as open-box and transparent as possible, so we provide a glossary of terms, concepts, and definitions that are used in the platform. The links to the web interface and API platform are as follows:
- [Sectors: Indonesia financial data layer](https://sectors.app)
- [Sectors API](https://sectors.app/api)
- [Sectors Financial Backend for Enterprises](https://sectors.app/enterprise)
- [Sectors Glossary](https://github.com/supertypeai/sectors-kb/wiki)
- [Sectors Recipe](/recipe/README.md)
